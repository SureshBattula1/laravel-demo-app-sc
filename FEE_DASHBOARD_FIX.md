# ✅ Fee Display Issue - FIXED!

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**

The dashboard wasn't showing student fees because of **column name mismatch**.

### **Actual Table Structure** (fee_payments):
```sql
- amount_paid (decimal)          ← Correct name
- payment_status (enum)          ← Correct name: Pending, Completed, Failed, Refunded
- payment_date (datetime)
- total_amount (decimal)
```

### **Dashboard Was Querying:**
```sql
- paid_amount   ← WRONG! (doesn't exist)
- status        ← WRONG! (doesn't exist)
```

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **Fixed DashboardController Query:**

**Before:**
```php
DB::raw('SUM(CASE WHEN status = "Paid" THEN paid_amount ELSE 0 END) as collected')
//                       ^^^^^^ Wrong!     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Wrong!
```

**After:**
```php
DB::raw('SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = "Completed" THEN amount_paid ELSE 0 END) as collected')
//                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Correct!     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Correct!
```

### **Complete Fix:**

```php
$feesStats = $feesQuery->select(
    // Collected: payment_status = "Completed"
    DB::raw('SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = "Completed" THEN amount_paid ELSE 0 END) as collected'),
    
    // Pending: payment_status = "Pending"
    DB::raw('SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = "Pending" THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) as pending'),
    
    // Overdue/Failed: payment_status = "Failed"
    DB::raw('SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = "Failed" THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) as overdue'),
    
    // Total
    DB::raw('SUM(total_amount) as total'),
    DB::raw('COUNT(*) as total_transactions')
)->first();
```
